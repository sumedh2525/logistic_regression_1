    "Linear Regression:\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting linear line that minimizes the difference between the observed data points and the predictions made by the linear equation. It's primarily used for predicting continuous numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome (1/0, True/False, Yes/No) based on one or more independent variables. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous value, logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression. Linear regression could predict any value between negative infinity and positive infinity, which doesn't make sense for a binary classification problem. Logistic regression, on the other hand, can model the probability of an email being spam (1) or not (0) using the logistic function, which ensures that the output is between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of the email being spam.\n",
